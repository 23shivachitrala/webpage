            <p>Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit in good faith, and tens of millions already have!
        
                Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit readers by containing information on all branches of knowledge. Hosted by the
                Wikimedia Foundation, it consists of freely editable content, whose articles also have numerous links to guide
                readers
                to more information.
                Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism.
                Since its
                creation on January 15, 2001, it has grown into the world's largest reference website, attracting over a billion
                visitors monthly. It currently has more than sixty million articles in more than 300 languages, including
                6,645,899
                articles in English with 128,241 active contributors in the past month.
        
                Wikipedia's fundamental principles are summarized in its five pillars. The Wikipedia community has developed
                many
                policies and guidelines, although editors do not need to be familiar with them before contributing.

            Anyone can edit Wikipedia's text, references, and images. What is written is more important than who writes it. The
            content must conform with Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable by published sources. Editors' opinions,
            beliefs, personal experiences, unreviewed research, libelous material, and copyright violations will not remain.
            Wikipedia's software allows easy reversal of errors, and experienced editors watch and patrol bad edits.
